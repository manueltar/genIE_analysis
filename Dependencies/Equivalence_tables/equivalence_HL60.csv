Sample,Gene name,Average %HDR,,
,,Gdna,cDNA,
H1,FOXP1,0,0.18,Editing too low
H2,CUX1,3.61,3.34,"Nice editing, reads low and no difference"
H3,SH2B3,92.82,94.35,Looks too high editin. Check HL60 genome could it be the natural wt seq
H4,BRAP,19.12,,Repeat as no cDNA or could editing be causing expression knock down?
H5,UGCG,11.42,13.6127319,Possibly exciting difference in expression!
H6,DNMT1,0,0,Has not worked likely pcr band too big
H7,BID,6.04,7.04,Possibly exciting
H8,C2CD5,3.20,3.78,Looks like likely no difference
H9,FUT8,66.73,66.06,Looks like excellent editing but no difference
H10,EPB41,0.09,0.10,Editing too low
H11,LUC7L,0.14,0.13,Editing too low
H12,OVOL2,0.17,,Editing too low
